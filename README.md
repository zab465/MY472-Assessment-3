I find in my research that according to Spotify's popularity measure, 50 artists out of Rolling Stone Magazine's 100 best artists of all time can be said to endure today. I reach this conclusion under the assumption that all of these artists are highly popular and that their endurance to 2023 should be measured relative to the other artitsts in the list. 

As for the factors explaining endurance, the results of my analysis do not suggest that a certain factor is single-handedly responsible for artist endurance between 2010 and 2023, though I list a series of elements that may contribute to some degree.
